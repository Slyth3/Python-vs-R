# Python-vs-R
A battle of codes or just a battle of people

We take a look at  [Andrew's](https://github.com/Slyth3) knowledge of Python vs [David's](https://github.com/DaveisoR) knowledge of R and assign projects to compare if either language/person can complete the tasks 

Which language will come out on top
which person will brag till the end of time
